# Interviewing for Software Developer Jobs

---

# Application Submission üì¨
* Submit your application through the company's application tracking system (ATS).
* Some application tracking systems will screen out resumes that don't match the job description
* I built https://cv-boost.com to help tailor your resume for the job you are applying for

---

# Initial Screening üìû
* Assess your basic qualifications, skills, and fit for the position.
* You might have a phone interview with a recruiter or hiring manager
* Use https://shadowing.ai/ to practice

---

# Technical Interview üßë‚Äçüíª
* Solve coding exercises, technical challenges, or a small take-home project to assess your knowledge of algorithms, data structures, architecture, and problem-solving.
* Some may have you pair up with an engineer to solve a coding problem, review a pull request or do a code review to assess how you think and communicate
* Practice:
    - https://leetcode.com/
    - https://exercism.org/

---

# On-Site/Remote Interviews üé§
* This stage usually involves a series of interviews with different members of the engineering team, including software engineers, technical leads, managers, and sometimes even product managers or other team members.
* These interviews can cover various topics, including system design, software architecture, coding, algorithms, and behavioral questions.
* The purpose is to assess your technical abilities, problem-solving skills, communication, and how well you work in a team.

---

# Offer and Negotiation ü§ë
* If successful, they will extend an offer with details about compensation, benefits, and other relevant terms.
* At this point, you may have the opportunity to negotiate the offer 

---

# Rejection üò≠
* Don't take it personal
* It says more about the company than you
* Keep putting yourself out there

---

# Focus on what you can control üôå
* Keep your resume updated and tailored to the job https://cv-boost.com
* Work on coding problems at https://leetcode.com and https://exercism.org/
* Practice interviewing https://shadowing.ai/
